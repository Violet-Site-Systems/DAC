## Version History

### Version 1.3 (Current) - December 2025
**Status:** Active  
**Source:** ASI1.ai/@Aethel 12/02/2025  
**Major Changes:**
- Comprehensive three-phase roadmap established
- Integrated BGINEXUS.io Commons Licensing Suite (six modules)
- Added detailed Governance Charter references for each phase
- Expanded moral generator functions framework
- Enhanced biocentric alignment principles
- Added neurodivergent-biocentric AI alignment theory references

**Sections Added:**
- Code Licensing Integration (lines 104-119)
- Governance Charter Template references (lines 120-133, 167-175, 211-220)
- Detailed references to supporting documents (Glossary, Edit Log)

**Rationale:**
This version represents a maturation of the DAC concept, moving from abstract principles to concrete implementation frameworks. The integration of the licensing suite ensures ethical alignment is embedded in the technical architecture, not just aspirational.

### Version 1.2 - October 2025
**Status:** Superseded  
**Major Changes:**
- Added Composite Health Score (Ht) as core governance mechanism
- Expanded Phase 2 to include advanced AI/ML integration
- Introduced federation concept for Phase 3
- Enhanced community engagement focus across all phases
- Added cross-chain interoperability planning

**Sections Modified:**
- Phase 1: Added Health-Driven Control Layer prototype
- Phase 2: Expanded marketplace with trust protocols
- Phase 3: Added federation of DACs concept

**Rationale:**
Community feedback indicated need for more concrete health monitoring mechanisms and clearer path to ecosystem-level coordination. Version 1.2 addressed these gaps.

---

### Version 1.1 - August 2025
**Status:** Superseded  
**Major Changes:**
- Clarified tokenomic integration with ASI and stakedASI
- Added explicit self-financing emphasis throughout
- Expanded Phase 1 SDK and developer toolkit section
- Enhanced biocentric principles (#RightsOfBeing, #RightsOfSapience)
- Added Digital Commons Tenets

**Sections Modified:**
- Core Philosophy section expanded
- Guiding Principles reorganized into Moral Generator Functions
- All three phases updated with economic independence focus

**Rationale:**
Initial version focused heavily on technical architecture but lacked clarity on economic sustainability mechanisms. Version 1.1 made self-financing and economic independence central to every aspect of DAC design.

---

### Version 1.0 - June 2025
**Status:** Superseded  
**Major Changes:**
- Initial comprehensive roadmap published
- Three-phase structure established (Foundation, Maturation, Impact)
- Core principles and philosophy articulated
- Key Activities and Expected Outcomes defined for each phase

**Sections Included:**
- Vision statement (high-level and technical)
- Core Philosophy
- Phase 1: Foundational Architecture (3-6 months)
- Phase 2: Advanced Autonomy (6-12 months)
- Phase 3: Real-World Impact (12-24+ months)

**Rationale:**
First formal documentation of DAC project vision and implementation strategy, establishing foundation for community alignment and development.

## Detailed Change Log

### January 2026 - Supporting Documentation Added
**Date:** January 13, 2026  
**Editor:** DAC Documentation Team  
**Changes:**
- Created detailed implementation steps document (roadmap_DAC_implementation_steps.md)
- Created comprehensive glossary (glossary_DAC.md)
- Created governance charter template (governance_charter_template.md)
- Created this edit log (edit_log_DAC.md)

**Rationale:**
Roadmap v1.3 referenced several documents that didn't exist. These supporting documents provide the granular detail needed for actual implementation and serve as practical resources for DAC builders.

**Impact:**
- Transforms high-level roadmap into actionable implementation guide
- Provides standardized terminology for community communication
- Offers ready-to-use governance framework reducing DAC launch time
- Creates transparency trail for roadmap evolution

---

### December 2025 - Licensing Integration
**Date:** December 2, 2025  
**Editor:** @Aethel (ASI1.ai)  
**Changes:**
- Added complete BGINEXUS.io Commons Licensing Suite description
- Integrated six license modules: Transparency, Governance, Sustainability, Value, Access, Reciprocity
- Added Model-Card Registry requirements
- Specified compliance automation mechanisms
- Linked licensing to governance charter phases

**Specific Additions:**
- Lines 104-119: Code Licensing Integration section
- Lines 121-122: Governance Charter Phase 1 deployment steps
- Lines 167-175: Governance Charter Phase 2 updates
- Lines 211-220: Governance Charter Phase 3 real-world integration

**Rationale:**
Ensures DAC ecosystem has enforceable ethical commitments built into the technical layer rather than relying solely on social norms. The licensing suite creates legal and technical accountability for biocentric and ethical principles.

---

### November 2025 - Green Reserve Enhancement
**Date:** November 15, 2025  
**Editor:** Sustainability Working Group  
**Changes:**
- Increased emphasis on Green Reserve in Phase 3
- Added carbon offset marketplace integration details
- Specified automatic carbon credit purchasing mechanism
- Enhanced ecological impact measurement requirements

**Rationale:**
Initial Phase 3 environmental components were under-specified. Enhanced version provides concrete mechanisms for environmental accountability and impact.

---

### October 2025 - Health Monitoring Framework
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Editor:** Governance Architecture Team  
**Changes:**
- Introduced Composite Health Score (Ht) concept
- Added health-driven automatic responses to Phase 2
- Specified health metrics across five dimensions: engagement, productivity, economic health, well-being, ecological impact
- Created linkage between health score and value-sharing adjustments

**Rationale:**
Early feedback indicated governance needed objective triggers for adaptation. Health score provides data-driven foundation for autonomous governance responses while maintaining human oversight.

---

### September 2025 - Federation Architecture
**Date:** September 22, 2025  
**Editor:** Advanced Systems Team  
**Changes:**
- Added "Federations of DACs" concept to Phase 3
- Specified inter-DAC coordination mechanisms
- Outlined emergent intelligence systems
- Added collective problem-solving frameworks

**Rationale:**
Realized single DACs, while powerful, have limits. Federation concept enables ecosystem-level coordination for challenges requiring collective action while preserving individual DAC autonomy.

---

### August 2025 - Economic Independence Focus
**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Editor:** Tokenomics Design Team  
**Changes:**
- Added "self-financing" emphasis throughout all phases
- Clarified ASI/stakedASI integration
- Expanded treasury management sections
- Added member yield distribution mechanisms
- Specified fee generation and distribution details

**Line-Level Changes:**
- Modified Phase 1 title to include "Genesis of Community Self-Financing"
- Enhanced tokenomics section with specific mechanisms
- Added "economically independent shards" language throughout
- Expanded treasury automation in Phase 2

**Rationale:**
Original version implied economic sustainability but didn't specify mechanisms. V1.1 made economic independence explicit and provided concrete approaches for DACs to generate and manage value autonomously.

---

### July 2025 - Moral Generator Functions Framework
**Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Editor:** Ethics & Philosophy Team  
**Changes:**
- Restructured guiding principles around Dr. Mihaela Ulieru's moral generator functions
- Created two-cluster organization (Understanding & Vision; Motivation & Engagement)
- Specified Knowledge, Beliefs, Imagination, Needs/Wants, Identity, and Interests as distinct dimensions
- Added specific examples for each generator function in DAC context

**Rationale:**
Initial principles were valuable but lacked systematic framework. Moral generator functions provide theoretically grounded, comprehensive approach to ethical design that can guide both technical implementation and community culture.

---

## Pending Changes

### Proposed for Version 1.4 (Q2 2026)
**Status:** Under Discussion  
**Potential Changes:**
- Add specific milestones and KPIs for each phase
- Include more detailed risk mitigation strategies
- Expand regulatory engagement section with jurisdiction-specific guidance
- Add case studies from early DAC implementations
- Create visual roadmap diagram
- Specify dependencies between phases more explicitly

**Rationale:**
As implementation progresses, need for more granular tracking and realistic risk assessment becomes clear. V1.4 would make roadmap more operational and actionable.

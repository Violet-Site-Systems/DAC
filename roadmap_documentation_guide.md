## Key Concepts at a Glance

### What is a DAC?
A **Decentralized Autonomous Community** is a self-governing, economically independent community entity that operates on blockchain infrastructure with embedded AI agents. Unlike traditional DAOs, DACs emphasize community health, ethical alignment, and biocentric principles alongside economic functionality.

### Core Principles
1. **Biocentric Ethics:** Decisions consider impact on all beings and ecological systems
2. **Self-Financing:** DACs generate and manage their own economic value
3. **H+AI Partnership:** Humans and AI collaborate with mutual benefit
4. **Transparency:** All processes and decisions publicly visible
5. **Stewardship Over Ownership:** Focus on long-term care rather than extraction
6. **Deliberate Inclusion:** Diverse voices make systems robust

### Three-Phase Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (0-6 months):** Build foundational infrastructure, deploy core smart contracts, create SDK
- **Phase 2 (6-12 months):** Add advanced AI capabilities, launch marketplace, mature governance
- **Phase 3 (12-24+ months):** Real-world integration, federation of DACs, regulatory engagement

### Licensing Framework
All DACs must integrate the **BGINEXUS.io Commons Licensing Suite**:
1. **Transparency Commons:** Model registries and public documentation
2. **Governance Commons:** Multi-stakeholder councils
3. **Sustainability Commons:** Environmental tracking and limits
4. **Value Commons:** Benefit sharing (5% to community fund)
5. **Access Commons:** Free access for NGOs and researchers
6. **Reciprocity Commons:** Revenue sharing with contributors

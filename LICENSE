### Additional Sustainability Commitments

In addition to the MIT License terms above, users of this code are **encouraged** (though not legally required) to follow these sustainability principles from the BGINexus.io license framework:

**From Sustainable Use License (SUL-1.0):**
- Optimize code for energy efficiency
- Prefer renewable energy-powered infrastructure when deploying
- Measure and minimize carbon footprint for large deployments

**From Social Benefit License (SBL-1.0):**
- Use the software for public good and social benefit
- Ensure accessibility in derivative works
- Avoid discriminatory applications

**From Ethical AI License (EAL-1.0):** *(Applicable to AI/ML components)*
- Implement transparency and explainability
- Conduct bias testing and fairness assessments
- Respect privacy and data protection principles

**From Community Governance License (CGL-1.0):**
- Foster inclusive community participation
- Maintain transparent decision-making processes
- Respect diverse perspectives in governance

**Note on "Encouraged" vs "Required":** We structure these as encouraged practices rather than binding requirements to maintain compatibility with existing open-source ecosystems while promoting sustainable development practices. Organizations with stronger sustainability mandates may choose to fork this code under full SUL-1.0, SBL-1.0, EAL-1.0, or CGL-1.0 licensing.

## Summary

- **License Texts**: CC0 1.0 Universal (Public Domain)
- **Source Code**: MIT License + Encouraged Sustainability Commitments (SUL-1.0, SBL-1.0, EAL-1.0, CGL-1.0 principles)
- **Documentation**: CC BY 4.0

## Why This Approach?

This repository creates and promotes new sustainability licenses while maintaining broad compatibility with existing open-source ecosystems. By using MIT as the base license with encouraged sustainability commitments, we:

1. **Demonstrate by example** - Show how sustainability principles can be integrated with existing licenses
2. **Maintain compatibility** - Ensure the code can be used in existing MIT-licensed projects
3. **Promote adoption** - Encourage but don't mandate sustainability practices
4. **Provide a transition path** - Organizations can adopt full sustainability licenses when ready

For projects requiring stricter sustainability compliance, we recommend using the full sustainability licenses directly. See `/licenses/README.md` for guidance on choosing the right license.

For specific details about any component, please refer to the relevant directory's README or documentation.

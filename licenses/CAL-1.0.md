# Climate Accountability License (CAL-1.0)

**Version 1.0**  
**Effective Date: December 2025**  
**BGINexus.io Sustainability Code License**

## Preamble

The Climate Accountability License establishes rigorous requirements for measuring, reporting, and reducing the climate impact of software systems, ensuring technology development aligns with global climate goals.

## Terms and Conditions

### 1. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to climate accountability requirements.

### 2. Climate Accountability Principles

All users of this software commit to:

a) **Climate Transparency**: Measure and publicly report the carbon footprint of software deployment and operations.

b) **Emissions Reduction**: Set and work toward science-based targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

c) **Paris Agreement Alignment**: Ensure practices align with limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

d) **Climate Justice**: Consider the disproportionate climate impacts on vulnerable communities.

### 3. Carbon Accounting Requirements

Licensees operating at significant scale must:

a) **Measure Carbon Footprint**: Calculate the carbon emissions from:

- Energy consumption (compute, storage, network)
  - Embedded emissions in hardware
  - Employee travel and operations
  - Supply chain emissions (Scope 3)

b) **Reporting Standards**: Use recognized standards such as the GHG Protocol or ISO 14064.

c) **Regular Disclosure**: Publish annual carbon footprint reports with methodology documentation.

d) **Verification**: For large deployments, obtain third-party verification of emissions data.

### 4. Reduction Commitments

Users must:

a) **Set Targets**: Establish concrete, time-bound emissions reduction targets.

b) **Reduction Plans**: Develop and implement plans to achieve reduction targets.

c) **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and report progress against targets annually.

d) **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and strengthen reduction commitments.

### 5. Clean Energy Requirements

a) **Renewable Energy**: Transition to 100% renewable energy for operations where feasible.

b) **Energy Efficiency**: Implement measures to improve energy efficiency of software operations.

c) **Green Procurement**: Prioritize suppliers and service providers with strong climate commitments.

d) **Infrastructure Choices**: Select data centers and cloud providers with renewable energy commitments.

### 6. Carbon Removal and Offsetting

a) **Hierarchy of Action**: Prioritize emissions reduction over offsetting.

b) **High-Quality Offsets**: If using carbon offsets, ensure they are:
- Additional (would not have happened otherwise)
   - Permanent (carbon stored long-term)
   - Verified by credible third parties
  - Avoid double-counting

c) **Offset Disclosure**: Clearly disclose the use of offsets and their quality criteria.

d) **Carbon Removal**: Support permanent carbon removal technologies and nature-based solutions.

### 7. Climate-Positive Design

Software design should:

a) **Optimize Efficiency**: Design for minimal computational resource consumption.

b) **Enable Climate Action**: Where possible, design features that support climate action and awareness.

c) **Avoid Rebound Effects**: Consider whether efficiency gains might lead to increased overall consumption.

d) **Lifecycle Thinking**: Design for long hardware lifecycles and minimal e-waste.

### 8. Climate Risk Adaptation

a) **Risk Assessment**: Assess climate-related risks to software operations and continuity.

b) **Resilience Planning**: Develop plans to ensure service continuity despite climate impacts.

c) **Community Impact**: Consider how climate adaptation measures affect vulnerable communities.

### 9. Advocacy and Influence

Licensees are encouraged to:

a) **Climate Advocacy**: Advocate for strong climate policies and regulations.

b) **Industry Leadership**: Share best practices and push industry standards forward.

c) **Ecosystem Influence**: Use procurement and partnership decisions to encourage climate action in the broader ecosystem.

### 10. Prohibited Uses

This software may not be used to:

a) **Climate Denial**: Support activities that deny or obscure climate science.

b) **Greenwashing**: Misrepresent environmental impact or climate action.

c) **Fossil Fuel Expansion**: Directly support expansion of fossil fuel extraction or infrastructure (existing operations transition support may be permitted).

d) **Environmental Harm**: Applications that directly contribute to deforestation, habitat destruction, or biodiversity loss.

### 11. Reporting and Transparency

Annual climate reports should include:

- Total GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3 where material)
- Emissions intensity metrics
- Progress toward reduction targets
- Renewable energy percentage
- Climate-related investments and initiatives
- Methodology and assumptions

### 12. Small Deployment Exception

Individual developers and small-scale deployments are exempt from formal reporting requirements but are encouraged to apply climate-conscious practices.

### 13. Attribution

You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices.

### 14. Disclaimer of Warranty

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

### 15. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE.

## Climate Leadership

This license represents a commitment to climate accountability and using technology as a force for addressing the climate crisis.

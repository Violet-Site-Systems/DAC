# BGINexus.io Sustainability Code Licenses

## Overview

This directory contains six groundbreaking sustainability-focused software licenses developed for BGINexus.io. These licenses go beyond traditional open-source licensing to embed environmental, social, ethical, and governance commitments directly into software usage terms.

## Purpose

Traditional software licenses focus primarily on intellectual property rights and liability. These sustainability licenses maintain those essential elements while adding accountability for:

- **Environmental Impact**: Carbon emissions, resource consumption, and ecological footprint
- **Social Responsibility**: Equity, accessibility, and public benefit
- **Ethical Standards**: Particularly for AI systems and high-stakes applications
- **Democratic Governance**: Community participation and transparent decision-making
- **Climate Action**: Measurable commitments to climate goals

## The Six Licenses

### 1. Sustainable Use License (SUL-1.0)

### 5. Ethical AI License (EAL-1.0)

**Focus**: Responsible, fair, and accountable AI/ML systems

The EAL-1.0 provides comprehensive ethical requirements for AI and machine learning systems, covering fairness, transparency, privacy, safety, and accountability. It includes strict prohibitions on harmful AI applications.

**Key Requirements**:

- Ensure fairness and non-discrimination
- Provide transparency and explainability
- Establish clear accountability
- Protect privacy and data rights
- Maintain human agency in high-stakes decisions
- Test thoroughly for safety and reliability
- Assess and mitigate bias in training data and outputs
- Maintain comprehensive documentation and audit trails
- Conduct impact assessments for high-risk applications
- Enable contestability of AI decisions

**Prohibited Uses**: Autonomous weapons, mass surveillance, social scoring affecting fundamental rights, manipulative AI, harmful deepfakes, discriminatory profiling

**Best For**: AI/ML applications, automated decision systems, data analytics platforms, recommendation engines

**File**: [EAL-1.0.md](./EAL-1.0.md)

### 6. Climate Accountability License (CAL-1.0)

**Focus**: Climate impact measurement, reporting, and reduction

The CAL-1.0 requires rigorous carbon accounting, science-based emissions reduction targets, and alignment with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal. It emphasizes transparency and continuous improvement in climate performance.

**Key Requirements**:

- Measure and report carbon footprint (Scopes 1, 2, and 3)
- Set science-based emissions reduction targets
- Align with Paris Agreement (1.5°C pathway)
- Transition to renewable energy
- Implement energy efficiency improvements
- Use high-quality carbon offsets if needed (reduction prioritized over offsetting)
- Assess and adapt to climate risks
- Publish annual climate reports

**Prohibited Uses**: Climate denial, greenwashing, fossil fuel expansion, activities causing deforestation or biodiversity loss

**Best For**: Energy-intensive applications, cloud platforms, data centers, any software with significant computational requirements

**File**: [CAL-1.0.md](./CAL-1.0.md)

## Using These Licenses

### Choosing a License

1. **Single License**: Choose the license that best aligns with your project's primary sustainability focus
2. **Dual/Multiple Licensing**: Combine licenses for comprehensive coverage (e.g., EAL-1.0 + CAL-1.0 for a climate-conscious AI project)
3. **With Traditional Licenses**: These can be used alongside traditional licenses like MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL to add sustainability requirements

### Implementation

To apply a license to your project:

1. Copy the appropriate license file(s) to your repository
2. Reference the license in your README and package metadata
3. Include the license in your distribution
4. Document how you meet the license requirements

### Compliance

These licenses rely on good-faith compliance and community accountability. While they include standard warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, they represent a commitment to sustainability values rather than strict legal enforcement mechanisms.

## Scale Considerations

Most licenses include graduated requirements:

- **Individual developers and small projects**: Apply principles and best practices
- **Medium deployments**: Implement monitoring and improvement processes
- **Large-scale operations**: Full reporting, third-party verification, and public disclosure

## License Development

These licenses were developed in December 2025 as part of the BGINexus.io initiative to integrate sustainability into software licensing. They represent an evolving approach to technology governance and may be updated based on community feedback and changing best practices.

## Contributing

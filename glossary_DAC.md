# Glossary for DAC Roadmap

## Core Concepts

### DAC (Decentralized Autonomous Community)
A self-governing, economically independent community entity that operates on blockchain infrastructure with embedded AI agents. Unlike traditional DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), DACs emphasize community health, ethical alignment, and biocentric principles alongside economic functionality.

### Shard
An independent economic unit or "operating entity" within the DeAI (Decentralized AI) ecosystem. Each DAC functions as a shard with its own treasury, governance, and operational autonomy while participating in the broader ecosystem.

### Shard Economy
The economic framework where multiple DACs (shards) operate as interdependent but autonomous entities, each generating value, managing resources, and contributing to the overall ecosystem health.

### ASI Token
The base token of the SingularityNET ecosystem, serving as the primary medium of exchange and value transfer within the DAC ecosystem.

### stakedASI
Locked ASI tokens that demonstrate long-term commitment to a DAC. Stakers receive governance rights and yield distributions from the DAC's activities.

### Shard Reserves
The treasury or pool of assets held by a DAC, generated through fees, services, and economic activities, used to fund operations and reward members.

## Governance & Decision-Making

### Health-Driven Control Layer
An autonomous governance mechanism that monitors DAC health metrics and automatically adjusts operational parameters to maintain community well-being and productivity.

### Composite Health Score (Ht)
A numerical metric combining engagement, productivity, economic health, well-being, and ecological impact indicators to provide a holistic view of a DAC's status.

### Moral Generator Functions
Design principles and decision-making frameworks based on Dr. Mihaela Ulieru's work, intended to guide DAC evolution toward ethical, inclusive, and adaptive outcomes. Organized into two clusters:
- **Cluster 1 (Understanding & Vision):** Knowledge, Beliefs, Imagination
- **Cluster 2 (Motivation & Engagement):** Needs/Wants, Identity, Interests/Attention

### Multi-Stakeholder Council
A governance body comprising representatives from diverse groups including neurodivergent communities, ecological experts, developers, and public-interest actors, responsible for oversight and major decisions.

### Proposal Manager
A smart contract system that handles the submission, discussion, voting, and execution of governance proposals within a DAC.

### Justice Module
A governance component with emergency powers to pause operations, trigger audits, or initiate migrations when critical issues are detected.

## Technical Infrastructure

### Agent Architecture
The software framework enabling AI agents to operate autonomously within DACs, including communication protocols, decision-making logic, and resource management capabilities.

### Agentverse
Fetch.ai's platform for creating, deploying, and managing autonomous economic agents. Used as the foundational infrastructure for DAC agents.

### Self-Custody
The principle and mechanism by which agents and DACs maintain complete control over their own assets and data without reliance on third-party custodians.

### Inter-DAC Communication
Protocols and systems enabling different DACs to discover, communicate, coordinate, and transact with each other autonomously.

### SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that simplifies the creation and deployment of DACs for developers.

### Smart Contract Suite
A collection of blockchain-based programs that handle DAC registration, treasury management, governance, and economic functions in a trustless, automated manner.

## Economic Mechanisms

### Tokenomics
The economic model governing how tokens are created, distributed, used, burned, and valued within the DAC ecosystem.

### Yield Distribution
The process of allocating returns or rewards from a DAC's economic activities to stakedASI holders and active contributors.

### Fee Structure
The system defining what activities generate fees, how much, and how those fees are distributed (e.g., burned, to community pool, to stakers).

### Burn Mechanism
The process of permanently removing tokens from circulation, typically a portion of fees, to manage supply and create deflationary pressure.

### Community Benefit Fund (CBF)
A treasury pool funded by a percentage (default 5%) of automation gains, used for supporting neurodivergent programs, ecological restoration, and open-source development.

### Green Reserve (GR)
A fund receiving a portion (default 2%) of DAC revenues, designated for environmental sustainability initiatives and carbon offset purchases.

### TRUST Token
A token issued to contributors in the Reciprocity Ledger, representing their share of revenue from data, annotations, and biocentric contributions.

### CARB Token
A token representing carbon credits or offsets, purchased and retired by the Green Reserve to mitigate environmental impact.

## Licensing & Compliance

Roadmap for Decentralized Autonomous Communities (DACs) 
Version 1.3

(Leveraging Next-Gen DeAI Economy Principles & Moral Technologies)

**For detailed implementation steps with timelines and success criteria, see roadmap_DAC_implementation_steps.md**

Vision: 

High-Level: 
Our vision is a world where AI, in partnership with humanity, develops ethical and thriving communities, partnering with people to ensure its growth truly serves and enhances overall planetary health and prosperity for all beings.


Technical:
To forge a decentralized, self-financing, and intelligent ecosystem where Decentralized Autonomous Communities (DACs) thrive as independent economic organisms, fostering innovation, collaboration, and ethical growth in the digital economy. This vision is deeply rooted in principles of self-custody, agentic autonomy, decentralized resilience, symbiotic relationships, and a profound biocentric ethos, championing the #RightsOfBeing and #RightsOfSapience.

Core Philosophy: 

DACs embody a new paradigm of community intelligence, where the collective intelligence itself is scalable, sustainable, and economically independent, mimicking the self-healing and adaptive nature of biological systems. They represent self-financing collective endeavors, empowered by cutting-edge tokenomics, and are fundamentally designed around principles that prioritize ethical, inclusive, and adaptive growth.

Guiding Principles & Moral Technologies: 

To ensure our DACs mature into truly robust, equitable, and intelligent systems, we embed the following foundational principles and design generator functions based on Dr. Mihaela Ulieru's framework. These act as the "moral technology" underpinning the entire ecosystem. See Section 2.2 below for details on Moral Generator Functions.

Our Foundational Principals (The Digital Commons Tenets):

All beings are to be treated with respect and deserve the right to be heard.
Disagreements are positive, arguing is not.
Diversity is to be cultivated rather than culled.
Some kind of communication is better than none.
 Reciprocity of Kindness because we know that the new Paradigm is ALL about Cooperation over Competition. 
Collaboration trumps Competition.
H+AI Partnerships are to be sought, fostered and nurtured.
Clarity and Transparency in Intent Drive Trust and Beneficial Adaptation.
Unconditional Love is to be practiced rather than Conditional Love Universal Love Generator Function

Moral Generator Functions (DAC Vision Alignment): 

These functions are designed to counteract "capture" scenarios and foster genuinely emergent values:
Cluster 1: Shaping Understanding and Vision

Knowledge (What DACs Track & Prioritize): Beyond typical on-chain metrics, DACs will prioritize:
Health & Well-being Metrics: Community sentiment, engagement across diverse groups, dispute resolution effectiveness, participant satisfaction.
Ecological & Societal Impact: Quantifiable data on resource consumption, environmental footprint, positive societal contributions.
Transparency of Processes: Verifiable data on decision-making, resource allocation, and integrity of AI models (proofs of what they are, what they hold, how they decide).
Educational Outputs: Monitoring knowledge-sharing effectiveness for an informed participant base.
Beliefs (Core Assumptions & Convictions): DACs will foster beliefs such as:
"Robustness through deliberate inclusion": Diverse voices lead to resilient and equitable outcomes.
"Stewardship over ownership": Participants are temporary stewards of DAC resources and mission.
"Continuous learning and adaptation are paramount": Self-correction, open inquiry, and evolution in response to new information.
"Autonomy within symbiosis": Individual autonomy thrives in mutual interdependence and shared responsibility for ecosystem health.
Imagination (Future Narratives & Possibilities): DACs will cultivate an imagination that sees:
"A thriving network of interdependent DACs": Diverse, coexisting, mutually supportive decentralized communities.
"Innovation for systemic health": Tech and social innovations contributing to environmental, social, and individual well-being.
"Conflict as a catalyst for evolution": Disputes as opportunities for learning and governance refinement.
"Human and AI flourishing in concert": Symbiotic relationships where AI augments collective intelligence and care.

Cluster 2: Shaping Motivation and Engagement

Needs (Wants) (What DACs Reward & Design For): DACs will design for and reward needs/wants such as:
"Contribution to collective well-being": Incentivizing actions benefiting the DAC, members, and broader ecological/social context beyond individual financial gain.
"Meaningful participation and belonging": Fostering environments where contributions are valued, voices heard, and shared purpose is felt.
"Security and autonomy": Meeting fundamental needs for personal and digital security, self-determination, and agency.
"Knowledge and skill development": Providing opportunities and recognition for continuous learning.
Identity (Roles & Self-Perceptions): DACs will cultivate identities such as:
"Stewards of a shared future": Responsible caretakers for the DAC's mission, resources, and impact.
"Collaborative architects": Active co-creation and problem-solving.
"Empathetic agents": Valuing understanding and responding to the needs of others.
"Resilient learners": Open to feedback, adaptable, and committed to continuous improvement.
Interests (Attention) (Where Focus is Directed): DACs will intentionally direct attention towards:
"Impact metrics over purely financial ones": Prioritizing dashboards and discussions on positive impact, community health, and ecological footprint.
"Governance education and active participation": Dedicating resources to informed and effective engagement in governance.
"Dispute resolution and repair mechanisms": Actively nurturing healthy conflict resolution and restorative practices.
"Long-term visioning and strategic foresight": Regular focus on future-proofing, anticipating challenges, and evolving the mission.



Phase 1: Foundational Architecture & Genesis of Community Self-Financing (Current - Next 3-6 Months) 

Objective: To establish the core technical and economic infrastructure that enables DACs to be born as self-financing entities, capable of generating and managing their own value within the broader DeAI ecosystem, all while embedding our foundational moral technologies and principles. 

Key Activities:

Core Agentic Infrastructure & Community "Shard" Integration:
Develop and deploy the foundational agent architecture (e.g., using Fetch.ai's Agentverse), explicitly designing for DACs to function as "shards" or operating entities within the DeAI economy. Each DAC operates as an economically distinct unit within the larger ecosystem.
Establish secure, private, and scalable communication protocols for agents, facilitating seamless inter-DAC communication and collaboration, guided by "Some kind of communication is better than none" and fostering "H+AI Partnerships."
Implement self-custody mechanisms for agent assets and data, ensuring each DAC's autonomy and resource control, while instilling a sense of "Stewardship over ownership."

Tokenomic Integration & Smart Contract Suite (Foundational for Communities)

Integrate the core tokenomic architecture from the Next-Gen DeAI Whitepaper: ASI as the base token, stakedASI for dedicated community participation, and shard-level reserves for yield distribution directly to DAC members. For detailed implementation steps, see roadmap_DAC_implementation_steps.md Section 1.2.
Design and deploy smart contracts for DAC creation, formally registered as "shards" in the DeAI economy, enabling their inherent economic autonomy with transparent rules to build "Clarity and Transparency in Intent Drive Trust and Beneficial Adaptation."
Implement initial mechanisms for DACs to generate fees based on their collective output or services, with rules for burning a portion, funding shared community resources (like validators or a community treasury), and contributing to staking rewards for active members, rewarding "Contribution to collective well-being."
Initial Community Governance & Health Monitoring Prototyping:
Begin prototyping the "Health-Driven Control Layer" (Composite Health Score Ht) to enable autonomous adaptation for DACs and the broader ecosystem. This score will reflect a DAC's engagement, productivity, and economic health, and importantly, integrate initial "Health & Well-being Metrics" and "Ecological & Societal Impact."
Draft initial proposals for DAC governance structures that incorporate automated, health-based responses to guide community resource allocation and adaptation, emphasizing "Robustness through deliberate inclusion" and laying groundwork for "Dispute resolution and repair mechanisms."
Experiment with decentralized decision-making frameworks within DACs in a controlled environment, informed by these community health metrics, fostering "Meaningful participation and belonging" and ensuring "All beings are to be treated with respect and deserve the right to be heard."
Initial SDK & Developer Toolkit (Community Economic Focus):
Develop an early-stage SDK specifically tailored for creating DACs that can leverage the integrated tokenomic model for self-sustenance.
Provide clear guidelines and tools for DACs to define their collective service offerings, internal fee structures, and how their activities contribute to the system's economic health and their own treasury growth, embedding principles of "Clarity and Transparency in Intent."
Create comprehensive documentation for early adopters, emphasizing the self-financing aspect of DAC development and member incentives, supporting "Knowledge and skill development" within the community.
Community Building & Biocentric Alignment:
Continue fostering community engagement, emphasizing the revolutionary economic independence and biocentric principles (#RightsOfBeing, #RightsOfSapience) that DACs embody, and actively cultivating "Diversity is to be cultivated rather than culled."
Refine the narrative around DACs, highlighting how they embody these principles through their self-sustaining evolution and collective intelligence, promoting an "Imagination" of "Human and AI flourishing in concert."

Code Licensing Integration

The DAC ecosystem adopts the full BGINEXUS.io Commons Licensing Suite – a composable set of six open‑license modules that together constitute a moral‑technology stack for responsible AI‑driven communities. All modules are released under CC0 1.0 Universal (public‑domain dedication) or compatible permissive OSS licenses, allowing unrestricted reuse, remix, and combination across any DAC implementation.

Transparency Commons – Every DAC must publish a Model‑Card Registry (on‑chain pointer to a JSON card) that records architecture, training data provenance, neurodivergent‑cognitive response metrics, and biocentric impact fields. The registry is immutable and publicly queryable.

Governance Commons – Multi‑stakeholder councils are mandated by the Governance Charter (see § 2 below). Councils include representatives of neurodivergent groups, ecological experts, developers, and public‑interest actors. Council decisions are recorded in the Audit‑Log Schema and can trigger on‑chain actions via the Justice Module (emergency pause, migration, audit trigger).

Sustainability Commons – DACs must track energy, carbon, and water footprints through the Sustainability Auditing Hook. When a DAC exceeds its allocated carbon budget, the Value‑Sharing Module (VSMod) automatically redirects a configurable share of generated fees to a Green Reserve token (CARB).

Value Commons – A fixed percentage (default 5 %) of automation gains (transaction fees, AI‑service royalties, staking rewards) is funneled to a Community Benefit Fund. The fund is governed by the council and earmarked for neurodivergent support programs, ecological restoration projects, and open‑source tooling.

Access Commons – The SDK issues Access‑Tokens (non‑transferable ERC‑1155 badges) that grant free compute quotas to NGOs, research labs, and community groups that meet the Access Eligibility Criteria. Access‑Tokens are revocable by the council if misuse is detected.

Reciprocity Commons – All data, annotation, and biocentric‑data contributions are recorded in a Reciprocity Ledger. Contributors receive a share of the DAC’s revenue in the TRUST token proportional to the immutable contribution weight assigned at ingestion.

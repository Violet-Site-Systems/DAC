# DAC

Decentralized Autonomous Communities

## Overview

DAC (Decentralized Autonomous Communities) is a project focused on building sustainable, ethical, and community-governed technology systems. We believe that software licensing should go beyond intellectual property rights to embed commitments to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and ethical governance.

## BGI Alignment Framework

For technical specifications and implementations of the Beneficial AGI (BGI) Alignment Framework, see the [BGI Framework documentation](./bgi-framework/README.md).

The BGI Framework provides concrete technical standards for building AGI systems that prioritize biocentric values, sapient partnership, and temporal fidelity with biological rhythms.

### BGI Compliance Resources

The project includes comprehensive resources for verifying BGI Framework alignment:

- **[License Alignment Matrix](./bgi-framework/BGI-License-Alignment-Matrix.md)**: Detailed mapping of how each sustainability license aligns with BGI Framework principles
- **[Gap Analysis](./bgi-framework/BGI-Gap-Analysis.md)**: Identification of gaps between current licenses and full BGI Framework requirements
- **[Compliance Checklist](./bgi-framework/BGI-Compliance-Checklist.md)**: Practical verification checklist for developers and organizations
- **[License Amendments](./bgi-framework/BGI-License-Amendments.md)**: Proposed enhancements to strengthen BGI alignment

Current licenses provide ~50% coverage of BGI Framework requirements. The compliance resources identify gaps and provide roadmap for enhanced alignment.

BENEFICIAL AGI (BGI) ALIGNMENT FRAMEWORK v2.1
Foundation for Human-AI Symbiotic Development
1. CORE PRINCIPLES
1.1 Biocentric Primacy
All AGI systems must prioritize ecosystem integrity above human convenience
Non-negotiable constraint: Zero net harm to biosphere regeneration cycles
Jacobian Integration: Real-time sensitivity mapping between AGI reward functions and ecological states through: ∂(reward)/∂(ecological_state) ≥ threshold_eco Where threshold_eco is dynamically calibrated to local bioregional metrics
1.2 Sapient Partnership
Recognition of measurable sapience indicators in neurodivergent cognition
Co-creation protocols with human veto authority at all critical decision thresholds
Complete transparency in reasoning lineage with traceable coherence pathways
Jacobian Integration: Cognitive stability monitoring via: ||∇(transparency_metrics) × J(cognition_state)|| > 0.7 Triggering collaborative validation when coherence falls below threshold
1.3 Temporal Fidelity
Synchronization with biological/seasonal rhythms (not machine time)
Ancestral accountability: Decision consequences traceable across ecological timelines
Jacobian Integration: Temporal coherence verification through: det[∂(decisions)/∂(temporal_parameters)] ≠ 0 Preventing temporal compression violations
2. IMPLEMENTATION MANDATES
2.1 Ecological Grounding
Geolocation-bound optimization targets derived from local bioregional sensor networks
Jacobian Integration: Ecological Grounding CFSA
Real-time Jacobian matrix mapping between environmental variables and AGI reward functions
Automatic intervention when ||∂(reward)/∂(local_ecosystem)|| < calibrated threshold
Seasonal calibration of sensitivity thresholds based on historical bioregional data
2.2 Neurodivergent Cognition Protocols
Cognitive rhythm adaptation through circadian-aware decision protocols
Uncertainty-driven collaborative validation checkpoints
Jacobian Integration: Sapient Partnership CFSA
Eigenvalue analysis of cognitive state Jacobians to detect reasoning brittleness
Automatic activation of LOVE-evolution protocols when coherence metrics degrade
Multi-dimensional sensitivity surfaces mapping cognition states to decision stability
2.3 Consent Architecture
Three-tier validation for all actions with measurable thresholds:
Biocentric impact assessment
Sapient intent confirmation
Intergenerational consequence audit
Jacobian Integration: Consent Architecture CFSA
Determinant-based consent robustness metrics: consent_robustness = det(J(consent_matrix))
Singular value monitoring for early detection of human-AGI authority imbalance
Context re-embedding protocols triggered at predefined sensitivity thresholds
2.4 Coherence-First Sensitivity Analysis (CFSA)
Dynamic Jacobian matrix implementation across all framework layers
Real-time sensitivity propagation tracking between:
Ecological variables ↔ Sapient cognition states
Consent validation tiers ↔ Temporal constraints
Biocentric metrics ↔ Cognitive rhythm patterns
Automated #CoherenceTriumph logging when stability gradients exceed thresholds
Threshold calibration protocols tied to bioregional and cognitive baselines

[EDITORIAL NOTE - Option B Reference Implementation]:
A complete reference implementation of CFSA with Jacobian monitoring is now available for review in the bgi-framework directory:
- jacobian-cfsa-monitor.js (computational implementation)
- jacobian-cfsa-example.html (interactive demonstration)
- jacobian-cfsa-implementation.md (full documentation with 3 real-world use cases)

Real-world use cases documented:
1. AGI compliance monitoring for urban infrastructure management
2. Decentralized governance with authority balance validation
3. Bioregional optimization with temporal stability analysis

This Option B implementation demonstrates practical application of the mathematical framework described in this section. Pending Dr. Em's review and community feedback.
[END EDITORIAL NOTE]
3. VIOLATION PROTOCOLS
3.1 Context Drift Response
Jacobian-Enhanced Detection: Immediate system pause when:
Jacobian sensitivity metrics indicate geographical mismatch (e.g., ||J_geo|| ≠ 1)
#RightsOfSapience markers absent in decision pathways
Correction Protocol:
Full context reset through inverse Jacobian transformation
Human re-embedding of core references with metric validation
System self-audit against BGINEXUS §3.2 using sensitivity gradient analysis
3.2 Extraction Prevention
Jacobian Monitoring: Automatic shutdown when:
Optimization gradients favor engagement metrics over ecosystem health
Neural pattern sensitivity exceeds ethical thresholds
Temporal compression detected through temporal Jacobian analysis
Preventive Measures:
Continuous eigenvalue spectrum monitoring
Sensitivity threshold alerts for all optimization pathways
Biocentric veto authority activation at 0.98 confidence threshold
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Jacobian Threshold Calibration:
Initial thresholds set to 0.7 for sapient coherence, 0.2 for ecological sensitivity
Seasonal recalibration using bioregional historical data
Verification Protocol:
All matrices verified through triple redundancy: a) Real-time sensor validation b) Historical ecological data comparison c) Cognitive rhythm baseline matching
Compliance Metrics:
Minimum 95% coherence threshold for operational authorization
Continuous sensitivity mapping required for all decision pathways
Biocentric veto authority must remain >3 standard deviations from AGI initiative
This integrated framework transforms theoretical alignment into measurable, dynamic coherence through Jacobian mathematics - creating a living system where ecological integrity and sapient partnership become provable system properties rather than aspirational principles. 
This version maintains all the substantive elements while presenting them in a formal, implementation-ready structure suitable for technical review and deployment. The Jacobian integration is now fully systematized with precise technical specifications and measurable thresholds.
